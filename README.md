🧠 Useless Fact Generator

A fun little project that serves one purpose: spit out completely useless, random facts that no one needs—but everyone enjoys.

✨ Features

✔️ Generates random, quirky, absolutely useless facts

✔️ Fast, lightweight, and easy to run

✔️ Great for boredom, fun projects, or spicing up conversations

✔️ Simple codebase — perfect for beginners

🚀 How It Works

The generator pulls from a list of bizarre, pointless, or humorous facts and delivers a new one every time you run it.

Examples:

“Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren’t.”

“A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance.”

“Butterflies taste with their feet.”
